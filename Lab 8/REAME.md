## Tutorial 1: 


In this Tutorial, we used fusion 360 to model a basic camera mount for our raspberry pi camera. We have a lot of experience with CAD and 3D modeling software so this was a very simple part to create. The hardest part was figuring out that the center hole was a center point rectangle with center point arc that trims the rectangle and not a filet on the rectangle. Otherwise no real issues with this tutorial.
